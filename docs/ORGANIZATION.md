## File And Folder Descriptions

> Each file and folder provided has a general purpose. While those files and folders can be moved, removed, or repurposed, keeping the majority of the structure intact will make it easier to create and adhere to a standard.

### REMOVE-THIS.txt Files

> REMOVE-THIS files do nothing. They are placeholders designed to ensure that folders exist.

### /code/

> The root code folder is where source code goes. Content posts will sometimes include attempts at programming. This folder will consist of post-named folders where such programming efforts go. Sub-sub-folders may be created to organize the programming efforts better as needed.

### /docs/

> The root docs folder is where the bulk of repository documentation and content efforts go. A few exceptions to the rule are the CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, and README files that need to be in the root folder for GitHub purposes. Use the docs folder for more extensive documentation projects.

### /docs/content/

> The docs content folder is where more substantial documentation efforts go. Content posts will be placed here in their folders. The name of the post folders will be used in other related folders to keep content organized together. Files should be named based on their revisions while drafting. Final versions of content posts should be called "post."

### /docs/examples/

> The docs examples folder is where documentation examples go. Most will be inline, and some require more in-depth explanations and pre-setup. This folder will include post-named folders where such cases go. For those examples, additional sub-folders and files will be placed here as needed. Examples of using a content concept mentioned in a post go here. If a content post includes coding or scripting efforts, usage examples of those efforts also go here.

### /docs/research/

> The docs research folder is where documentation research goes. Researching concepts does not always fit neatly into documentation efforts. Some researching efforts do not necessarily lead to meaningful changes or updates for the project. This folder will include post-named folders where such research goes. For those research efforts, files should be placed here with additional sub-folders and files as needed, and they will consist of links, books, or other content. Research should include any found reference or note taken. Organize research in files named by the queried concept. Link any relevant historical code, content, examples, analysis, resources, scripts, or tests in a document called "history."

### /docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

> The contributing document specifies how a person can get started with modifying the repository. It also explains the process of accepting or rejecting changes.

### /docs/ORGANIZATION.md

> The organization document is this document. It explains the purposes of the main files and folders to be used in the repository.

### /docs/STYLE.md

> The style document describes how efforts are to be formatted and provides a way to maintain consistency within efforts.

### /resources/

> The root resources folder is storage for media used in documentation efforts. This folder will include post-named folders where such resources go. Shared resources should go in the base folder, but sub-folders may consist of shared resources that are not post-specific.

### /resources/default-01-thumb.jpg

> The image file default-01-thumb is the thumbnail of the first default image.

### /resources/default-01.jpg

> The image file default-01 is the first default image.

### /resources/default-02-thumb.jpg

> The image file default-02-thumb is the thumbnail of the second default image.

### /resources/default-02.jpg

> The image file default-02 is the second default image.

### /scripts/

> The root scripts folder is where scripts go. Content posts will sometimes include attempts at scripting. This folder will consist of post-named folders where such scripting efforts go. Sub-sub-folders may be created to organize the scripting efforts better as needed.

### /tests/

> The root tests folder is where tests go. Content posts will sometimes include attempts at testing. This folder will consist of post-named folders where such testing efforts go. Sub-sub-folders may be created to organize the testing efforts better as needed.

### /CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

> The code of conduct specifies how project collaborators should treat each other. It includes the social responsibilities of the parties involved.

### /LICENSE

> The license document describes how to handle the copyright of the material.

### /README.md

> The readme document is used to describe the repository in general terms and to provide enough information to help a would-be contributor get started.

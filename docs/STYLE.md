## Philosophy

> Our general purpose is to create something simple, elegant, and easy to read. To these ends, we design and change functionality based on these core philosophies:

- Prefer simplicity over complexity
- Prefer single-issue content over multiple-issue content
- Avoid duplicating existing-issue content
- Comment to make issue content understandable
- Space to make issue content readable
- Name to make issue content navigable

---

## General Documenting

> Often, there are multiple ways to design, draft, and write to get desired content.  Content guidelines help to make content easier to follow. To these ends, keep the following in mind:

- Plan issue content
- Outline, research, fact check before writing
- Save sketches, research, and fact checks into /docs/research/
- Do not use copyrighted material without following appropriate copyright rules
- Find or create images and videos with proper copyrights to enhance the content
- Create informative and provocative headlines
- Write content on single issues if possible
- Edit content before posting, ensuring correct grammar and spelling
- Cut out repetitious sections and shorten overly flowery or wordy sentences
- Don't be a perfectionist
- Don't be afraid to scrap or postpone content if it doesn't get to a point or align with the message you wish to put out
- Read your content out loud before posting, making sure it flows the way you intend
- Use Oxford commas

---

## Commenting

> Commenting is intended to make the purpose and usage of content more easily understood. To this end, keep the following in mind:

- Comment often
- Do not comment on obvious content sections
- Explain the purpose of content sections
- Clarify sub-sections with comments
- Comment files at the top
- Research often further clarifies comments, so leave links to the specific research
- Use comments for drafts
- Convert comments into footnotes and links to research for final content posts

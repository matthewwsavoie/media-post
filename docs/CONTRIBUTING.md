## Getting Started

> From time to time, different issues, features, changes, and efforts will shift priority. While changes in the following listed areas are all welcome, some change requests may be put off or even completely ignored if the changes do not correspond or at least align with stated priorities. The current priorities may be found in the [project documentation][doc-2].

- Enhancements
- Errors
- Documentation
- Translations

> Like other repositories, the two main ways to contribute are through Issues and Pull Requests. Feel free to use either option, whichever you prefer.

---

## Help Wanted

> Before you decide to open an issue, browse [open issues][web-2] to see current requests. We also generally want to hear about:

- Suggesting enhancements
- Reporting errors
- Reporting typos
- Suggesting clearer wording
- Recommending design improvements

> [Open an issue][web-3] to tell us about any of the above. You may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

> **NOTE:** Use task lists in issues, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. Include only one work item per issue to create alerts when our community solves problems. In turn, this provides visible resolution to everyone watching.

> If you decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that we will merge it directly. It's not because we don't like your ideas, but because we will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

> In general, before we make official changes to our repository, we will open a pull request in this repository, showing all the draft changes on a working branch. In that pull request, we will do our best to cross-link back to open issues or pull requests that we think are resolved or addressed by the draft changes. When those draft changes are ready to be published, we will make them on the official live version [here][web-1]. After that, we'll merge the working branch in this repository.

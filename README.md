## Getting Started

> Creating quality content does not begin with the post itself. Instead, it starts with infrastructure. While you could jump into the process of posting content, having a specific purpose for creating content, and putting support in place to meet specific goals will help you maintain longterm success. Following the advice below will help you solidify your goals and give you options to achieve those goals.

> ---

### Setup

#### Find Your Big Idea

> The big idea is your theme and broad concept. It should be specific enough to fit a particular need yet comprehensive enough to provide unlimited material. A topic should have an audience waiting to consume its content. It should keep the author interested and engaged enough to want to produce relevant content regularly.

#### Choose Your Audience

> The author should be the first and most interested audience member. Assuming growing the audience is a crucial goal of producing content, create content with the audience in mind. Cater to your audience and lean on them for help in improving content. Interact with your audience within a constant feedback loop. Grow audience participation with a call to actions and email lists. The author should make it easy for audience members to share content through social media.

#### Determine Your Content Type

> Primary content types include blogs, podcasts, images, and videos. You may choose multiple content types to work with, but one should be your primary focus. Each content serves a different need and requires a different approach. Blogs inform but work best when telling a story. Podcasts work best when someone masterfully illustrates a concept. Images entertain or provide information in a pithy way. Videos do all the things but are best served in small distinct chunks to maximize entertainment and audience attention spans.

#### Decide On Web Hosting

> The choice of website hosting is a difficult one. Some web platforms exist to aid in delivering a specific content type. The same dedication to content type can, in turn, limit your ability to branch out on the same platform. Choosing hosting that requires you to build your site from the ground up gives you much more flexibility but requires more significant time and technical skill on your part. Some hosting options provide the right mix allowing flexibility in hosting different content types while not imposing huge technical and time requirements on you.

#### Consider Posting Frequency

> Posting frequency only matters if regularly posting has some value to you. If you create content for yourself and your audience, it is beneficial to create content on a regular schedule. Scheduled posts should occur once a month or more frequently. Give yourself and your audience a regular day to expect content delivery (e.g., 1st of the month). Keep your promise to deliver to your audience regularly. Remember, frequent quality content creates site popularity, and a good monetization strategy plays off increasing content popularity.

### Money

#### Drill Into Monetization

> The choice of whether to monetize is a difficult one. Once you have decided to do so, you still have the option of using ads, taking donations, selling your products, or performing affiliate marketing. If sales are your primary motivation to produce content, then content should be seen to supplement the products. Being too overt in sales and marketing can turn off your audience. Enabling website advertisements or direct advertising in podcasts or video may be the right choice when available. When you decide to use advertising, do so sparingly so as not to turn your audience off your content. If the purpose of creating content is the purpose unto itself, taking donations makes more sense. Donations allow the audience to vote on content with their dollars. A combination of monetization is often the best strategy, but do so tactfully, or it will look like a money grab and your audience will leave you.

#### Delve Into Donations

> Donations are a way for patrons to show their appreciation and encourage you to continue your efforts. There are two types of donation strategies: "single" and "ongoing." Both ways require thought and planning to be effective. The "single" donation strategy means a patron pays you once, either for a post or for your content generally. Be sure to thank your patron directly if possible. It may be beneficial to have a one-time support tier system where different amounts of money trigger different types of gifts for delivery to your patron. Make tiers of support overt and explicit, so your patrons know what to expect. Make a point to give something away at every level. You don't need to break the bank or put in a ton of effort, only to give what is readily producible, yet unique to your efforts. The "ongoing" donation strategy takes the "single" donation strategy and uses it for the amount of money given per post. Another tier should be used to track collective giving goals as well. Then you can give one-time gifts to your patrons for helping reach those goals. In this way, you thank your patrons at every point and simultaneously encourage donations and engagement.

#### Sell Successfully

> If you wish to sell products alongside producing content, your products should be relevant to your big idea and the content you provide. Digital goods are much easier to manage than physical items requiring inventory levels. Before pushing the first product, ask your audience what they like, and if providing merchandise works for them. Periodically change products based on audience feedback. Try to keep your offerings small so that you can keep your inventories low as well as better watch purchasing trends.

#### Advertise On Purpose

> The most common type of web advertising is the page ad. Page ads do not require much tweaking, but placement should only appear in moderation. Podcast ads and video product placements should be selected from your interests and placed sparingly. When advertising, ask your audience how they feel about the pitch. When advertising, make ads personal. Above all else, respect your audience.

#### Leverage Affiliate Associations

> Affiliate marketing efforts should follow the same advice as for advertising. Be transparent with your audience about affiliate associations. Use affiliate marketing only when you feel comfortable using the product or service yourself. Again, respect your audience.

### Interactions

#### Post With Confidence

> Posting new content can be straightforward if you keep a few rules in mind. When posting, keep content as simple as possible. Make sure to stay on topic and keep points brief, coherent, and to the point. Try to tell a compelling story. Give your audience what they want when what they want is known. Try not to deviate too far from the big idea. Be aware of copyright laws: do not steal. For blogs, include images and videos when possible. For podcasts and videos, provide quality show notes. If selling something, ask for the sale. If monetizing with donations, ask for support, and always thank your patrons. Direct writing and speaking as if talking to a single audience member. If you must go off topic, make sure to connect the interlude back in a relevant way. Be kind. Be inclusive.

#### Send In Social Media

> Posting is not complete unless you inform your audience. With social media, summarize content in ways specific to the social media type. Create image memes of quotes from posted content. Post to social media concurrently with content posts. Be clear in your object. Be kind and inclusive. Expect social media to act as an extension of comments: engage with fans, accept good-faith criticism, and mute trolls. Use social media to let your audience learn about you beyond the content posts. Be careful only to show your audience what you want them to see. Don't feel the need to respond to everything, but be consistent in the type of things you react to and in how you reply to them. Posting on social media and appropriately responding should help drive content engagement.

#### Curate Your Comments

> Comments are potentially more important than social media. Use the same strategy used for social media with some caveats. Plan to interact with comments associated with a content post for a set time. Incorporate criticism and suggestions into future content. Ignore comments at your own risk. Be very careful about deleting comments; have a specific policy on allowable comment material. Consider freezing comments for a post after a particular timeframe; freezing means not needing to respond to and curate everything continually. Especially engage with your fans and thank them for their consuming and engaging with your content.

### Guests

#### Never Neglect The Guest

> Occasionally you will be approached by or have the opportunity to work with someone working in an adjacent industry who would be willing to collaborate in some way. When you have this opportunity, look before you leap. Make a point to vet the person or organization thoroughly before working together. When you feel comfortable with taking the next steps, make sure to keep the collaboration reciprocal.  See what they want in return. Be willing to allow them to promote their work in your content and ask to do the same in theirs. If the collaboration does not work out, be kind, and keep lines of communication open. You never know what opportunities may grow out of such a first contact.
